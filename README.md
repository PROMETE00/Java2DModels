## Project Description

This Java application demonstrates fundamental 2D graphics transformations and color space conversions. The program features:

### Core Functionality:
- **Geometric Transformations**:
  - Translation (moving objects)
  - Scaling (resizing objects)
  - Rotation (turning objects)
  - Skewing (slanting objects)
  
- **Supported Shapes**:
  - Basic polygons: Triangle, Rectangle, Pentagon, Hexagon
  - Circle/ellipse rendering

- **Color Space Conversions**:
  - RGB (Red-Green-Blue)
  - CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Key)
  - HSL (Hue-Saturation-Lightness)
  - HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value)

### Technical Implementation:
- Built using Java's 2D graphics API
- Interactive GUI for transformation controls
- Real-time color space visualization

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the main application class
3. Select a shape from the menu
4. Apply transformations using the control panel
5. Switch between color schemes to see different representations

## Development

This project serves as an educational resource for:
- Computer graphics fundamentals
- Java 2D programming
- Color theory implementation
- Geometric transformations
